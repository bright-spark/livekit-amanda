# Agent Startup Optimizer

This document explains the agent startup optimizer implementation in the LiveKit Amanda project.

## Overview

The agent startup optimizer is designed to make the LiveKit Amanda agent responsive as quickly as possible while loading tools in a prioritized sequence. This ensures that the agent can respond to user queries immediately, even while more complex tools are still being loaded in the background.

## Key Features

1. **Immediate Responsiveness**: The agent becomes responsive to user queries within milliseconds of startup, even before all tools are loaded.

2. **Prioritized Tool Loading**: Tools are loaded in a specific sequence based on their importance and dependencies:
   - Basic tools (time, date) are loaded first
   - Search tools are loaded next
   - Job search tools follow
   - Enhanced search with RAG is loaded after that
   - MCP tools are loaded last

3. **Background Processing**: All tool loading happens in the background using asyncio tasks, allowing the agent to remain responsive throughout the startup process.

4. **Progressive Capability Announcement**: As new tools become available, the agent's instructions are updated to reflect its growing capabilities.

5. **Environment-Based Configuration**: The optimizer respects all environment variables and only loads tools that are enabled.

## Implementation Details

The optimizer is implemented in `agent_startup_optimizer.py` and consists of the following key components:

### AgentStartupOptimizer Class

This class manages the entire startup sequence and provides methods for loading different types of tools.

#### Key Methods

- `initialize_agent()`: Entry point that starts the optimized startup sequence
- `make_agent_responsive()`: Makes the agent responsive with minimal instructions
- `load_basic_tools()`: Loads basic time and date tools
- `load_search_tools()`: Loads search tools based on enabled providers
- `load_job_search_tools()`: Loads job search tools if enabled
- `load_enhanced_search()`: Loads enhanced search with RAG if enabled
- `load_mcp_tools()`: Loads MCP tools if enabled
- `update_agent_instructions()`: Updates the agent's instructions based on currently loaded tools
- `finalize_agent_configuration()`: Finalizes the agent configuration after all tools are loaded

### optimized_entrypoint Function

This function replaces the original entrypoint in `agent.py` and initializes the agent using the optimizer.

## Usage

The optimizer is automatically used when the agent starts. No additional configuration is required.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can interact with the agent immediately without waiting for all tools to load.

2. **Reduced Perceived Latency**: Even though some tools may take time to load, the agent can already respond to basic queries.

3. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Tools are loaded only when needed and only if they're enabled in the environment.

4. **Better Error Handling**: If a tool fails to load, the agent continues to function with the tools that did load successfully.

5. **Transparent Progress Updates**: The agent's instructions are updated as tools become available, providing transparency to the user.

## Configuration

The optimizer respects the following environment variables:

```
# Search engines
BRAVE_SEARCH_ENABLE=true
DUCKDUCKGO_SEARCH_ENABLE=true
BING_SEARCH_ENABLE=true
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENABLE=true
WIKIPEDIA_ENABLE=true

# Job search tools
LOCANTO_ENABLE=true
INDEED_ENABLE=true

# Other tools
LOCAL_TOOLS=true
MCP_CLIENT=true
OPENWEATHER_ENABLE=true

# Enhanced search with RAG
ENHANCED_SEARCH_ENABLE_RAG=true
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_EMBEDDING=true
```

## Logging

The optimizer logs detailed information about the startup sequence, including:

- Which tools are being loaded
- When tools become available
- Any errors that occur during tool loading
- The final state of the agent after all tools are loaded

This information can be useful for debugging and monitoring the agent's startup process.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the optimizer include:

1. **Dynamic Tool Prioritization**: Adjust the loading sequence based on user behavior and tool usage patterns.

2. **Lazy Loading**: Load tools only when they're first requested, rather than loading all enabled tools at startup.

3. **Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitor tool health and reload tools that fail during operation.

4. **Performance Metrics**: Collect and report metrics on tool loading times and agent responsiveness.

## Conclusion

The agent startup optimizer significantly improves the user experience by making the agent responsive immediately while loading tools in the background. This approach ensures that the agent can provide value to users from the moment it starts, even before all its capabilities are fully loaded.
